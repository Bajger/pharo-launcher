Pharo Launcher comes with a few settings you can customize.

**WARNING: Settings are only persisted by clicking on the "Store settings" button!** If you do not click on "Store settings", settings changes will only apply for the current Pharo Launcher session (i.e. until you quit Pharo Launcher).

## Network
* Use HTTP proxy ? If checked then the you will be able to set a port number and a server name. If unchecked, then no http proxy is used.

## Behavior
* Templates cleared at startup: When enabled, Launcher startup clears the Templates List. When disabled, Launcher startup retains the Templates List from last run.
* Quit on Launch: When enabled, Pharo Launcher quits when an image is launched. When disabled, Pharo Launcher stays alive when an image is launched.
* Warn on architecture mismatch? Get a warning when trying to launch an image with a different architecture than the Launcher (i.e. trying to launch a 32-bit image from Pharo Launcher 64-bit).
* Check for template sources update? Check regularly (each day) if Pharo Launcher Template official sources has an update available (needs internet access)

## Danger zone
